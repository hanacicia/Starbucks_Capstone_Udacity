## Motivation
This Project is the Capstone project of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The goal of this project is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.

## Getting Started

### Libraries used
* python 3.x,
* numpy, 
* pandas, 
* scikit-learn,
* json,
* matplotlib,
* seaborn,
* datetime

### File Descriptions

    - portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
    - profile.json - demographic data for each customer
    - transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
